Ligti Media is an innovative technology company with the goal to disrupt hardware solutions behind video walls. 

****

Most people today think of video walls as something expensive, loud and hot. 

****

Ligti Media makes video walls cost-effective, easy to install and energy efficient.

****

Compared to the competition:

* We replace up to 24 video players and a server with a single computer making it easier to maintain

****

* We reduce the power consumption by up to 90%

****

* We reduce the heat from 60 degrees celsius to around 35-40 degrees celsius

Since we reduce the heat with up to 40% it also helps to increase the lifespan of the computers

****

* We reduce the noise level to below 30 decibels.

(70 decibels is a vacuum cleaner and 11 decibels is dropping a needle in a silent room)

****

With our solution, airports, train stations, corporate headquarters, shopping malls, control rooms and more can install video walls that are affordable and environmentally friendly. We also dramatically reduce the amount of computers, operating systems and third party software needed to operate the video walls.
